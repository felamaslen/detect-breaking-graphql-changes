# detect-breaking-graphql-changes

This is a Github Action to detect breaking changes on a GraphQL schema.

## Usage

Example: `.github/workflows/graphql.yml`:

```
name: GraphQL breaking changes
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - .github/workflows/graphql.yml
      - schema.graphql
jobs:
  detect-breaking-changes:
    permissions:
      contents: read
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: felamaslen/detect-breaking-graphql-changes
        with:
          base_ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}
          schema: schema.graphql
```

This will detect any dangerous and breaking changes on the version of `schema.graphql` between `base_ref` and `HEAD`.

## CLI Usage

This package also provides a command-line interface for comparing GraphQL schemas locally.

### Installation

Install the package globally:

```bash
npm install -g detect-breaking-graphql-changes
```

Or use it directly with npx:

```bash
npx detect-breaking-graphql-changes
```

### Usage

```bash
detect-breaking-graphql-changes <from-schema> <to-schema>
```

**Arguments:**
- `from-schema`: Path to the original GraphQL schema file
- `to-schema`: Path to the new GraphQL schema file

**Example:**

```bash
detect-breaking-graphql-changes schema-old.graphql schema-new.graphql
```

### Output

The CLI provides color-coded output:

- **ðŸ”´ Breaking Changes**: Changes that will break existing clients (shown in red)
- **ðŸŸ  Dangerous Changes**: Changes that might affect clients but won't break them (shown in orange)  
- **ðŸŸ¢ Success**: No breaking or dangerous changes detected (shown in green)

Each change includes:
- Description of the change
- Resource name affected
- Change type
- Location in the schema file
- Deprecation status (if applicable)

**Exit Codes:**
- `0`: Success (no breaking changes)
- `1`: Breaking changes detected
